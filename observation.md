## User Experience

### Initial Engagement
I had my friend Keaton try out BorrowerPath. He immediately locked onto the **3D globe** and spent a lot of time playing with it — rotating, zooming, and toggling layers. He noticed some of the globe map modes weren't working yet, but overall he thought it was fun and gave the app a "wow" factor.

### Borrower Journey
He set up his account as a borrower, created a deal, and tested out accepting demo deals. He really liked seeing the **AI/ML lender matching** run live, saying it felt like the "engine under the hood" of the platform.

### LinkedIn Integration
One thing that stood out for him was the **LinkedIn integration**. He thought it was slick but wanted me to build it out more so he could pull in more credibility data automatically.

### Admin Portal
I also gave him a peek at the **Admin Portal**. He thought the interactive globe lab there was just as fun as the borrower side. He also liked the new metrics dashboard, especially seeing live stats like:
- Deals created
- Offers made  
- Revenue trends

He said it gave the site more of a "real platform" feel, not just a demo.

## Key Takeaway
Keaton was most engaged with the globe and lender-matching model, but wants more depth on LinkedIn integration. He also saw real value in the Admin metrics — it made the product feel professional and data-driven.
