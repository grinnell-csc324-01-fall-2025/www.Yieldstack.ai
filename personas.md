# User Personas

## Persona 1: Morty the Borrower

### Background
Morty is a small real estate operator trying to scale up. He's eager but inexperienced, often overwhelmed by the traditional loan process.

### How he uses YieldStack

- **Borrower Intake Flow:** Starts by entering deal info (loan amount, property type, purpose). He sometimes hesitates, second-guessing what fields really matter.

- **AI/ML Lender Matching:** Loves watching the matching model kick in, reacting like, *"Aw jeez Rick, this thing actually found me lenders right away!"*

- **Interactive 3D Globe:** Plays around with it more than needed because it feels exciting, even though it doesn't directly help him pick offers.

- **Offer Review:** Reviews lender offers in the dashboard but gets nervous about making the "wrong" choice. He appreciates the side-by-side term sheet comparison, which helps him feel less lost.

### Motivations
Wants **speed**, **clarity**, and **confidence** that his deal will actually close. Prefers simple steps with clear outcomes.

### Pain Points
- Easily distracted by visual features
- Confused if integrations (like LinkedIn) don't work smoothly
- Intimidated by diligence requirements

## Persona 2: Rick the Lender

### Background
Rick is a seasoned private lender. He's skeptical of new platforms, hates spam, and doesn't tolerate wasted time â€” but he's sharp and appreciates efficiency.

### How he uses YieldStack

- **Lender Profile Setup:** Sets up his profile fast, defining credit box, loan criteria, and regions.

- **Lender Inbox:** Lives inside the inbox, where YieldStack delivers filtered, pre-qualified deals. He grumbles, *"Finally, not the usual garbage."*

- **Deal Review:** Reviews deals through the Lender Dashboard, quickly rejecting mismatches and zeroing in on high-fit ones.

- **Terms Editor:** Uses it to push structured offers back to borrowers without endless email chains.

- **Admin Metrics:** Checks the dashboard to track pipeline stats (deals reviewed, offers made, revenue conversion), which reassures him the platform is serious, not fluff.

### Motivations
Wants only **relevant, high-quality deals** that fit his box. Saves time by avoiding spammy broker blasts.

### Pain Points
- Thinks globe visualizations are gimmicks unless directly tied to actionable insights
- Gets annoyed if compliance data is missing or the AI acts like a black box without explainability
