# Raw Needfinding (Interviews)

*Verbatim transcripts (anonymized)*

## Interview 1 — Client X (First ever client demo!!!!!! (demo attendee))

**Q:** What is your pricing?  
**A:** We take 0.5–0.75% on each deal; we only get paid when you close. We chose this model because we felt lenders hate paying for unused seats or fixed subscriptions — it aligns our incentives with theirs.

**Q:** What are the current services you are using?  
**A:** We are using product X, Y, and Z. They seem to be very different from you guys. Each has its own quirks and requires training our analysts, which eats into productivity.

**Q:** Do you mind running me through product X, Y, Z?  
**A:** Sure. Typical user flow: we get charged $X per month (5 figures), and we get a few deals annually — not even worth it for product X. Product Y we used to use a lot but it only does a very small part of the deal process and is a flat fee + monthly subscription (5 figures). Product Z — the company would spam us a lot and ended up failing. Honestly, we feel nickel‑and‑dimed and rarely see ROI.

**Q:** What is your firm's typical loan amount?  
**A:** Anywhere between XYZ–XYZ million. We lend out $500M annually. On a per‑deal basis, analysts can spend days chasing docs and spread models, so throughput matters.

**Q:** What type of properties do you focus on?  
**A:** Cash‑out refinance, single family, fix & flip, etc. Our mix changes with rates, but we need tools that adapt quickly rather than being locked into rigid templates.

**Q:** What challenges do you face with your current workflow?  
**A:** Mostly wasted time: redundant data entry, back‑and‑forth emails with brokers, and platforms that overpromise deal flow but deliver noise. Compliance tracking also takes effort.

**Q:** Would you want to see a quick demo?  
**A:** Sure. We like seeing how new platforms actually handle underwriting tasks in real time.

**Q:** Would you want to join our waitlist and become the first lender on our platform?  
**A:** Let's do it! As long as onboarding isn't heavy and we can try it on a couple of deals first.

## Interview 2 — Former CEO of Fintech Unicorn

**Q:** So what is it that you guys do?  
**A:** We are an AI‑powered commercial real estate finance platform — think traditional deal broker, but faster, cheaper, and never sleeps. What excites me is how you're blending automation with relationships, something most fintechs miss.

**Q:** What is the market size?  
**A:** Starting with XYZ region (less regulated), a $XYZB market. Honestly, if you can get even a small wedge here, it proves out your model. CRE finance is massive, and incumbents are slow to innovate.

**Q:** What risks or challenges do you see?  
**A:** Trust and compliance. Lenders will worry about data security and whether AI decisions can be explained. You'll also face adoption hurdles — credit teams are conservative. You'll need early champions.

**Q:** Do you know anyone in the industry you could connect us with?  
**A:** Sure — here's my number. I can introduce you to a few lenders I know who are frustrated with existing platforms. Also, you should speak to some brokers — they're often overlooked but control a lot of deal flow.

**Q:** Any advice for go‑to‑market?  
**A:** Don't boil the ocean. Nail one vertical, like mid‑market refi, and prove efficiency gains. Once you have case studies, scaling will be easier.

## Interview 3 — Real estate/CPA contact (OpenAI event)

**Contact:** OpenAI Guy, CPA — XYZ.AI

> "Hey Rommin, loved chatting with you. I have some seriously awesome tax breaks for people investing into commercial real estate. Let's chat! I'm part of the New York CPA commercial real estate committee. https://calendar.app.google/dpQc — I cracked the code to help CRE investors gain massive cash‑flow benefits."

### Follow‑up conversation notes:

- They explained that many investors underutilize tax strategies like **cost segregation** and **bonus depreciation**. He believes pairing financing with tax optimization creates stickier client relationships.

- He offered to walk through a recent case study where an operator saved millions in taxable income by restructuring debt and leveraging CPA guidance.

- Suggested that platforms like ours could differentiate by connecting borrowers not only with lenders but also with **trusted tax advisors**, making the financing decision more holistic.

- He was enthusiastic about collaborating on educational content for borrowers and saw a role for the CPA committee as a distribution channel.
